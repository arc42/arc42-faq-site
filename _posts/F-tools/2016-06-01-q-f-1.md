This is a classical _it depends_ type of question. 
Ask different people, get different (and most likely conflicting) answers...

* As arc42 documentation should always be a combination of text, tables and diagrams, a combination of different tools will often be a better choice than trying to get everything from a single tool (although tool vendors will tell you a different story)
* Often, (UML) modeling tools come with an abundance of functions and _very_ limited usability. Their learning curve is high and might frustrate many. Overall, team acceptance tends to be low. Despite these usability shortcomings we usually prefer _real_ modeling tools over a pure graphics editor, especially for their better model consistency.
* Text processors (like Microsoft Word&reg; or Open/Libre-Office) are _omnipresent_ (practically all stakeholders can use them), but developers and other techies often _don't love them_. Text processing tools provide limited team- and collaboration features, no real diff/merge, difficult to automate and are difficult to integrate with other tools. Nevertheless arc42 works with this category of tools without hassle.
* Plaintext-based approaches (like Markdown or AsciiDoc) in combination with graphics-tools (for smaller systems) or modeling tools (for medium to large systems) allow for documentation _close-to-source-code_ and a high degree of automatability - therefore they tend to enjoy high acceptance with development teams.
* If you strive for [_documentation-as-code_](https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/), docToolchain might be your option.
* We love the combination of wiki plus graphics- or modeling tool. You can generate stakeholder-specific artifacts or pdf from modern wiki systems (like Confluence&reg;).
