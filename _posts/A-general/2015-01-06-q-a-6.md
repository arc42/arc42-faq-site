* Simon Brown's [SA4D/C4](https://simonbrown.je/#softwarearchitecture) model.
You find a brief introduction in one of his [blog posts](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2014/10/simple-sketches-for-diagramming-your-software-architecture/)
    * You find several links comparing C4 and arc42 in [question B17](/questions/B-17/)
* [The View-Model](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0046XS3RO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
of Paul Clements et. al from the Software Engineering Institute.
From our point of view, their approach is _very_ heavyweight and can become quite
formal when applied to real-world projects.
* In case your organization has created its own "Software Architecture Documentation Template": It should contain quality requirements, a scope/context section and information about building blocks and crosscutting concepts. If it does, you're pretty close to arc42 anyway...
