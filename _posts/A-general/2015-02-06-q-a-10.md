Users of arc42 sometimes ask questions like:

> I documented my projects using the arc42-template, but the documents in our company need to satisfy specific Corporate-Identity guidelines, i.e. every page in office documents need a company-specific header and footer.
> These are major changes with respect to the original arc42-download version.
>I tried to respect the license by placing the arc42-logo and a "based on:" above it on the cover sheet. Is this enough regarding the creative commons license?

Our answer to such questions is:

arc42 does NOT require specific formating: You can freely use the template with any Corporate-Identity, layout, fonts, graphics, header, footer or other formating you require or like.

Just cite the “source” of the arc42 structure **anywhere**,
it doesn't need to be the title page...

We'd be happy if you could include a link (https://arc42.org or https://arc42.de)
in your documentation.... to help "spread-the-word".
