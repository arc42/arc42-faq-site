Users of arc42 inquired:

> I documented my system using the arc42-template. Does the arc42
license model somehow influence the license of this _template instance_?

>Do we need to open-source our documentation?

* You have absolutely NO obligation to publish or open-source your documentation
(that means: you can, of course, keep your documents private and/or closed-source)
* Your documentation can be put under any license or statutes you require.
* If you need your document to be secret or confidential, that's fine for us.


We'd be happy if you could include a link (http://arc42.org or http://arc42.de)
in your documentation.... to help "spread-the-word", though.
