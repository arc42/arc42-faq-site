Simon Browns [C4](https://c4model.com/) model is in widespread use to document software architectures.  

It has _many_ similarities to a few sections from arc42, but omits certain parts (e.g. quality requirements, crosscutting concepts, risks and a few others).

A number of practitioners and authors have compared both approaches, here you find some links:
