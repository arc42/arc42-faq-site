The trivial option (usually not recommended):
Just draw a line between two boxes to indicate that a dependency exists.

If you need more _serious_ options, you have at least the following
options (orderd by required effort for creating and maintaining such descriptions):

1. Give the line a label (to make it referencable) and explain its meaning
in a table below the diagram. This should be sufficient for many non-safety-critical systems.
2. Use the _provided/required_ notation (aka "ball/socket"), explicitely
denoting which services/data/events the providing building block offers. There's a nice
explanation by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BallAndSocket.html) on this option.
3. Use distinct interface building blocks.
4. Use ball-and-socket notation in combination with port symbols.


The following diagram shows all these options.
