Several alternatives compete with UML, the list below gives an overview
(just an arbitrary selection, not exhaustive):

* informal box- and line diagrams. They can be helpful and are often ok, but
please explain your notation, otherwise your diagrams are open for
(mis-)interpretation.
* Fundamental-Modeling-Notation (FMC), an (academic) approach to communicate
dynamic systems with block-diagrams, petri-nets and entity-relationship diagrams.
See the [FMC notation reference](https://www.fmc-modeling.org/notation_reference)
for details. FMC is rarely used in business or industrial systems, although
it's quite promising.
* [SysML](https://sysml.org/) is an UML dialect, created to support systems engineering.
Supported by numerous modeling tools, but in my opinion not practically relevant.
* Simon Browns pragmatic [C4](https://static.codingthearchitecture.com/c4.pdf) model of
software architecture description.
