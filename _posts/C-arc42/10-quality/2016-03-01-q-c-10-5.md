## Quality requirements are high-priority information

arc42 suggests to document or specify the top 3-5 quality requirements
in section 1.2 - right at the [start of the documentation](https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/).

That's helpful, as some of these requirements might influence the
most important, fundamental (or often expensive...) architecture decisions.

## System often have _many_ quality requirements

In real-world systems we often find >100 different quality scenarios,
way too many to digest _all-at-once_. That's why arc42 proposes
to document/specify this multitude in arc42 section 10...

See the following diagram for an overview where to specify/document
quality requirements:
