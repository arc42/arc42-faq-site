Yes - of course :-)

The following examples are taken from the [arc42 by Example](https://leanpub.com/arc42byexample) Leanpub book.

#### From the Html-Sanity-Checker example architecture

1. Implement HtmlSC mostly in the Groovy programming language and partially in Java
with minimal external dependencies.
2. Wrap this implementation into a Gradle plugin, so it can be used
within automated builds. Details are given in the
[Gradle userguide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
3. Apply the [_template-method-pattern_](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method/)
to enable:
  * multiple checking algorithms. See the [concept for checking algorithms](),
  * both HTML (file) and text (console) output. See the [reporting-concept]().

(Remark: Some hyperlinks in the paragraph above might not work,
  as they were only meant to be examples.)

|Flexible Data Structure |Database structure + persistence code is completely (100%) generated from UML-model |Persistence concept, section 8.1 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
|Flexibility in Transmission Formats (CSV and fix-record-formats |Create domain-specific languages for CSV and fix-format import/export configurations. Build an ANTLR based parser for these languages plus the corresponding interpreters. |Custom Eclipse Editor, Section 8.2 |

|Flexibility (Configurable CSV/fix formats) |Implement customized editor for CSV/fix DSL as Eclipse plugin |Custom Eclipse Editor, Section 8.2  |

(Remark: Again - no links to details are given in last column of the table - in any real architecture documentation you should prefer hyperlinks to just naming the sections.)
