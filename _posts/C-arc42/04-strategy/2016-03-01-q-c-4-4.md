It's often useful to explain important solution approaches (aka 'solution strategy')
together with the quality requirements those approaches help to achieve!

One idea is to combine quality requirements with solution approaches in a single
table with requirements on the left and solution approach on the right.

In practice, add (hyper-)links to detailed explanations, often given in arc42-section 8
(crosscutting concepts).


An example:


|Q-Requirement    |Architectural Approach                  |Details        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
|Flexibility: Database structure can be customized at installation time within one hour.Â |Database structure + persistence code is completely (100%) generated from UML-model |Persistence concept, section 8.1 |

(in a real-world system, the third column should be a hyperlink to the detailed description
  of the respective approach/strategy/concept).
