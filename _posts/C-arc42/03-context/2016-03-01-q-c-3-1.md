System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system).

It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

### Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among
your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

### Form

You can use either/or:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


### More information

You find additional information and tips in our extensive [documentation on the context](https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/).
