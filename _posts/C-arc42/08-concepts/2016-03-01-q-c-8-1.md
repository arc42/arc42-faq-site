Concepts provide solutions to recurring problems.


We use the term "concept" for rules, principles or other
decisions, guidelines, processes that influence one or more
elements of the architecture.

* Decisions, or concepts that cannot adequatly be assigned to a single building block
* Decisions or rules that influence several:
  * building blocks
  * parts of the implementation
  * runtime scenarios
  * interfaces
  * several developers


Other people like to call _crosscutting_ aspects by different names. In practice
we encountered the following terms:

* approaches
* aspects: like in "aspect-oriented-programming"
* concepts: our favorite
* principles
* regulations
* rules
* tactics: like in [design tactics](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=6593), a term coined in 2003 by the Software Engineering Institute. They define tactics as "architectural decisions that can be used to achieve desired quality attribute requirements"
* strategies
